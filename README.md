# NumTLib

## Overview 
NumTLib is a Python based library that is designed for numerous number theory operations. Whether you're a mathematician, computer scientist, or enthusiast, this library provides a set of functions to work with prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and other essential number theory concepts.

So far, NumTLib provides the following features:
- Eucledian Algorithm
- Greatest Common Divisor of Two Numbers
- Table of Primes and Composites
- Least Common Multiple of Two Numbers
- Fraction Addition and Subtraction Using GCD and LCM


**Note: This project is inspired based on the notes from my Number Theory course in my undergraduate studies as a math major and the book Number Theory: A Programmer's Guide by Mark Herkommer. Some of the features draw from both my notes and the book used but I also go further in adding different features to existing programs.**
